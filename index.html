            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p id="p">I am a 22 year old, soon to be graduate of Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Previous to university, I had initially started programming during high school, allowing me to be exposed to scripting languages and implementing basic functional programs. When I had reached university, I then began to learn object-oriented programming throughout my curriculum and grew an interest in pursuing a job to apply my growing knowledge. With personal projects and work experience, I have found that my love for software has continued to grow at an order of O(n<sup>3</sup>) and refused to stop.</p>
            <p id="p">
            Continously learning new technologies is difficult as I want to pursue my Electrical Engineering degree, but also require growing knowledge of software to pursue my career interests. Much of my software knowledge today is therefore self-taught through projects or my past experiences and I continue to learn this way.

                  While majoring in Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, I have been given the opportunity to broaden my academic spectrum by not only learning in accordance to my major but the major of Computer Engineering as well. Having the capability to take courses in Computer Engineering has given me the opportunity to take courses such as data structures and algorithms (<a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/aads/Outline/">ECE 250</a>) allowing me to grow my interest within development continously.

                  Over the 4 months spent at Blackberry, I was placed on the Big Data team in charge of growth and upkeep of all servers in their data centers. Using tools such as Chef, I was asked to produce a health check system that would run on all data nodes within their Hadoop cluster on boot-up. By doing so, when the hosts would PXE boot, the health check would run, giving information to dev-ops on the status of all servers. Secondly, I had built out an automation workflow to replace the manual approval and creation of user accounts within the cluster. This reduced approximately 5 man hours, and removed the input of multiple people throughout the process.

                  As a returning intern to Amplify, I was placed on the reporting web-app team. During this time, Amplify was deprecating old applications due to licensing requirements for users, and my initial project was to deprecate and replace a book-management system. This project was completely done using Java, where I had implemented the back-end logic of the application, and created API's to help communicate and format data to and from the back-end. Other projects I worked on included creating a JSON serialization and deserialization library as well as a plug-in framework to assist with instantiating dynamic applications as required, rather than all static applications booting up simultaneously.

While readjusting, analyzing and creating new data, I was able to enhance my data analysis and data management knowledge with the use of minor SQL and production of scripts.

On the business aspect, I was required to expand the company by creating product and services documentation, improve online presence on LinkedIn, and reach out to potential partners as well as future clients.

                  With previous experience working on the sales floor of a local Canadian Tire store, I was placed in charge of designing the new replenishment software later used by Canadian Tire employees across 200 stores. This co-op was split into three parts; initially gathering research data, secondly produce a conceptual design, and lastly beta test the software with multiple stores. As I aided in the design, I created multiple presentations which were showcased to the Technology Committee at the Canadian Tire Corporation headquarters. After finalizing the design with the committee, I was then able to support multiple stores in beta testing the software to reach its current design.
